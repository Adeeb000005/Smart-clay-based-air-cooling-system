# Smart-clay-based-air-cooling-system
Conventional air conditioners are harmful to health due to respiratory issues, dry skin, and
potential pathogen spread; they negatively impact the environment through greenhouse gas
emissions and ozone layer depletion, and they consume large amounts of energy leading to
high electricity bills, whereas my project, a clay-based air cooling system, is environmentfriendly with no health issues, utilizes only 12 volts of energy from solar power, leverages the
natural evaporative cooling properties of clay, and features a design that naturally compresses
air to further reduce the temperature efficiently. Our project leverages two major cooling
properties: evaporative cooling and air compression; clay's natural evaporative cooling
property is utilized by passing air through pipes with water poured over them, facilitated by
jute bags, honeycomb structure sheets, or wood wool to hold the water, enabling heat exchange
through evaporative cooling, while the pipe design enhances cooling through air compression,
with thicker pipes at the inlet and thinner pipes at the outlet, and baffles positioned to compress
the air and reduce its temperature, further controlled by a microcontroller system with
temperature and moisture sensors to monitor and automate water pouring using a sprinkler
system, water reservoir, water pump, and air deflectors connected to servo motors for
continuous operation.
